## 🆕 What's New (Added Today)

### 1. **Complete API Integration Library** 
`src/lib/api-integrations.ts` - Your Swiss Army knife for external services

#### 🗺️ Location Services
```typescript
// Convert address to coordinates
const coords = await geocodeAddress("123 Main St, NYC");
// Returns: { latitude, longitude, displayName, address }

// Convert coordinates to address
const address = await reverseGeocode(40.7128, -74.006);
// Returns: { displayName, address, city, country }

// Get user's location from IP
const location = await getIPLocation();
// Returns: { latitude, longitude, city, country, ip }

// Find nearby buildings/properties
const buildings = await getNearbyBuildings(lat, lon, 1000);
// Returns: Array of buildings with addresses, types
```

#### 🌐 Translation Services
```typescript
// Translate text
const translated = await translateText("Hello", "es");
// Returns: "Hola"

// Get supported languages
const langs = await getSupportedLanguages();
// Returns: [{code: 'en', name: 'English'}, ...]
```

#### 🔍 Transparency Tools
```typescript
// Look up any company
const companies = await getCompanyData("AIG Insurance", "us");
// Returns: Company details, status, address, incorporation date
```

#### 🛠️ Utilities
```typescript
// Generate Gravatar URL
const avatarUrl = await getGravatarUrl("user@example.com");

// Generate QR code for sharing
const qrCode = generateQRCode("https://collabconnect.com/user/123");

// Calculate distance between points
const km = calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2);

// Rate limiting helper
const limiter = new RateLimiter(10, 60000); // 10 calls per minute
await limiter.waitForSlot();
```

### 2. **Three New API Endpoints**

#### `/api/location` - Location Services
```bash
# Get user's IP location
GET /api/location?action=ip

# Geocode an address
GET /api/location?action=geocode&address=123 Main St, NYC

# Reverse geocode coordinates
GET /api/location?action=reverse&lat=40.7128&lon=-74.006

# Find nearby buildings
GET /api/location?action=nearby&lat=40.7128&lon=-74.006&radius=1000
```

#### `/api/translate` - Translation Service
```bash
# Translate text
POST /api/translate
Body: {
  "text": "Fight the power",
  "targetLang": "es",
  "sourceLang": "auto"
}

# Get supported languages
GET /api/translate
```

#### `/api/transparency` - Company Lookup
```bash
# Look up a company
GET /api/transparency?name=AIG Insurance&jurisdiction=us
```

// 2. Auto-translate their bio to English for others
const bio = "Luchando contra las aseguradoras";
const translated = await translateText(bio, "en");
// "Fighting against insurance companies"

// 3. Find nearby collaborators
const nearby = await getNearbyUsers(40.4168, -3.7038, 50); // 50km radius

## 🎭 Final Thoughts (In Character)

Here's the thing - and this is important - you asked for a tool to connect people and fight the system. Not a social network. Not a marketplace. A **weapon**.

And weapons need to be:
- **Reliable** - Check. All APIs tested.
- **Accessible** - Check. Multi-language, free forever.
- **Transparent** - Check. Open source approach, no secrets.
- **Effective** - Check. Real tools for real problems.

The insurance companies? They rely on people being isolated, confused, giving up. This platform breaks all of that.

The housing market? Designed to keep individuals powerless. Group bidding changes the game entirely.

And the map? That's not just pretty. That's **visibility**. When you can SEE that you're not alone, that there are people in every city fighting the same fights, that's when things get dangerous for the system.

**This is ready. This is working. This is the foundation.**

Now go build Phase 2 and watch what happens when people have the tools they need.
