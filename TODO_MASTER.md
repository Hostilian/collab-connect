## üéØ Immediate Next 5 Steps

1. **Test the Map** - Open http://localhost:3001/map and verify everything works

3. **Test Auth Flow** - Create a real user account and verify sign-in/out
4. **Connect Profile to DB** - Make profile editing actually save data
5. **Build Verification System** - Start with email verification

**Remember the Mission**: This isn't just another app. This is a tool to fight insurance companies that deny claims, to help people pool resources to buy homes together, to build transparent networks of trust. Every feature should serve the goal of empowering people to collaborate against powerful institutions.

**Stay Transparent**: Everything you build should embrace radical transparency. Account ages, verification levels, collaboration histories‚Äîit's all visible. That's how we build trust.

**Fight the Giants**: Insurance companies, real estate monopolies, predatory lenders‚Äîthey thrive on information asymmetry. We're building the antidote.
