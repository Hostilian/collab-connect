## You're here: Todo #5 - Setting up the database

Listen, this is the moment where the code becomes REAL. You've got all the pieces, now let's bring this beast to life.

### Step 1: Install PostgreSQL (if you haven't already)

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# Or use Chocolatey:
choco install postgresql
```

**Or use a cloud database (easier!):**
- Go to https://railway.app or https://supabase.com
- Create a free PostgreSQL database
- Copy the connection string

### Step 2: Create your .env fileeeee

```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

Now edit `.env` and set:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/collabconnect"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="run-this-command-to-generate"
```

**Generate a secure NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```cmd
# In Git Bash or WSL:
openssl rand -base64 32

# Or in PowerShell:
[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::GetBytes(32))
```

### Step 3: Run Prisma migrations

This creates all your database tables:

```cmd
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

You'll see magic happen - all those beautiful tables being created.

### Step 4: Generate Prisma Client

```cmd
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 5: Fire it up!

```cmd
npm run dev
```

Go to: http://localhost:3000

### Step 6: Create your first account

1. Click "Join the Movement"
2. Create an account
3. Sign in
4. You're in the revolution, baby!
