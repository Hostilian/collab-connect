## üìã YOUR IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Monitor Deployment (Now - 5 minutes)
```bash
# Open GitHub Actions
https://github.com/Hostilian/collab-connect/actions/runs/18650405298

# Watch for:
- Pre-deploy checks ‚úÖ (should be complete)
- Deploy production üîÑ (currently running)
- Production URL appears in job summary
- Smoke tests pass
```

### Step 2: Get Production URL (After deploy completes)
```bash
# In GitHub Actions:
1. Open the workflow run
2. Click on "deploy-production" job
3. Scroll to job summary
4. Copy the production URL (looks like: https://collab-connect-XXXXX.vercel.app)
```

### Step 3: Quick Health Checks (After URL obtained)
```cmd
REM Set your production URL
set PROD_URL=https://[YOUR-URL].vercel.app

REM Test home page
curl -f %PROD_URL%

REM Test health live (should return {"status":"alive"})
curl -f %PROD_URL%/api/health/live

REM Test health ready (should return {"status":"ready"})
curl -f %PROD_URL%/api/health/ready

REM Test XAI status (should return {"configured":true})
curl -f %PROD_URL%/api/ai/grok

REM Check security headers
curl -I %PROD_URL% | findstr "X-Frame-Options X-Content-Type-Options Strict-Transport-Security"
```

### Step 4: Browser Testing
```bash
# Open in browser:
https://[YOUR-URL].vercel.app              # Home page (modern dark UI)
https://[YOUR-URL].vercel.app/auth/signin  # Sign in page
https://[YOUR-URL].vercel.app/auth/signup  # Sign up page
https://[YOUR-URL].vercel.app/dashboard    # Dashboard (requires auth)
```

### Step 5: Monitor Auto-Redeploy (10-15 minutes after first deploy)
```bash
# Watch for new workflow run:
https://github.com/Hostilian/collab-connect/actions

# Look for: "Redeploy 10 minutes after deploy"
# This will automatically trigger a second deployment
```

## üö® IF DEPLOY FAILS - QUICK FIXES

### ‚ùå Issue: "Missing one or more required secrets"
```bash
# What it means: GitHub secrets not set
# Fix:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hostilian/collab-connect/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add these secrets:
   - VERCEL_TOKEN (from Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Tokens)
   - VERCEL_ORG_ID (from Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings)
   - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (from Vercel project settings)
3. Re-run the workflow
```

### ‚ùå Issue: "Missing DATABASE_URL in .env.production.local"
```bash
# What it means: Vercel environment variables not set
# Fix:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard ‚Üí collab-connect ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add these for Production, Preview, and Development:
   - DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection string)
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET (random 32+ character string)
   - NEXTAUTH_URL (your production URL)
   - XAI_API_KEY (from X.AI)
3. Redeploy (workflow will run automatically)
```

### ‚ùå Issue: Health Ready Returns 503
```bash
# What it means: Database connection failed
# Fix:
1. Verify DATABASE_URL format: postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
2. Check database is accessible from Vercel
3. Run migrations: npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### ‚ùå Issue: XAI Returns Not Configured
```bash
# What it means: XAI_API_KEY not set
# Fix:
1. Add XAI_API_KEY to Vercel environment variables
2. Redeploy
```
