## 🔵 What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Get a Database

Pick ONE:

**Option A: Railway.app (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign up (free tier)
3. Create "New Project"
4. Add "PostgreSQL"
5. Copy the connection string

**Option B: Supabase**
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create account
3. New project → Database
4. Copy connection string

**Option C: Local PostgreSQL**
1. Install PostgreSQL
2. Create database: `collab_connect`
3. Connection string: `postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/collab_connect`

### Step 2: Create .env File

```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add:
```env
DATABASE_URL="your-connection-string-here"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate-with-command-below"
```

Generate secret:
```cmd
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations

```cmd
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This creates all your tables. Magic!

### Step 4: Start the Server

```cmd
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Test It

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Join the Movement"
3. Create an account
4. Sign in
5. See your dashboard

## 🤔 Philosophy Check

Remember why you're building this:

> "The powerful don't want you to organize. So let's organize."

This isn't just code. This is:
- ⚖️ **Justice** - Fighting insurance companies together
- 🏠 **Opportunity** - Buying houses collaboratively  
- 🌍 **Connection** - Finding your people across the world
- 💎 **Transparency** - No hiding, no BS, just real humans

Every bug you fix, every feature you build, every line you write - it's all in service of helping real people solve real problems together.

That's the kind of work that matters.

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

1. **Check QUICKSTART.md** - Detailed instructions
2. **Check errors** - VS Code shows them in the Problems panel
3. **Check the database** - Run `npx prisma studio` to browse
4. **Check the logs** - Terminal shows what's happening
5. **Ask me!** - I'm right here

---

## 🎬 After You Get It Running

Once you see that dashboard with your name on it, come back and we'll tackle:

1. **Profile editing** - Let users customize everything
2. **The map** - Beautiful, interactive, Apple Maps-style
3. **Verification** - Build trust through transparency
4. **Discovery** - Connect people with shared interests

But first: **Get. The. Database. Running.**

Everything else builds on that foundation.

## 📊 Progress Bar

```
Foundation Phase: ████████░░ 80%
Overall Project:  ██░░░░░░░░ 8%
```

You're so close to having a working app. Like, SO close. Database → Dev server → Account creation → Dashboard.

Four steps. Maybe 20 minutes.

Then you'll have something REAL to show. Something you can click around in. Something that works.

Let's get there.

**GO. BUILD. CHANGE THE WORLD.**

(But start with the database connection. That's important too.)
