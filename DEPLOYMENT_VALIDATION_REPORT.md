## 🧪 Health Check Endpoints

### Critical Endpoints to Test

Once production URL is available:

**1. Home Page**
```bash
GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/
Expected: 200 OK, HTML with CollabConnect
```

**2. Health Live**
```bash
GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/api/health/live
Expected: { "status": "alive", "timestamp": "..." }
```

**3. Health Ready**
```bash
GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/api/health/ready
Expected: { "status": "ready", "checks": { "database": "ok", "email": "ok" } }
```

**4. XAI Configuration**
```bash
GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/api/ai/grok
Expected: { "status": "ok", "configured": true, "message": "XAI API is configured" }
```

**5. Auth Pages**
```bash
GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/auth/signin
GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/auth/signup
GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/dashboard
Expected: 200 OK for all
```

## 📋 Validation Steps (To Execute After Deployment)

### Immediate Validation (0-5 minutes)
```bash
# Set production URL (get from GitHub Actions job summary)
set PROD_URL=https://[YOUR-URL].vercel.app

# Test home page
curl -f %PROD_URL%

# Test health live
curl -f %PROD_URL%/api/health/live

# Test health ready
curl -f %PROD_URL%/api/health/ready

# Test XAI status
curl -f %PROD_URL%/api/ai/grok
```

### Security Headers Validation
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I %PROD_URL% | findstr "X-Frame-Options X-Content-Type-Options Strict-Transport-Security Content-Security-Policy"
```

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Open home page in browser
- [ ] Verify modern dark UI loads
- [ ] Test sign in page (/auth/signin)
- [ ] Test sign up page (/auth/signup)
- [ ] Attempt Google OAuth flow
- [ ] Check dashboard requires auth
- [ ] Verify map component renders (if MAPTILER_KEY set)

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run Lighthouse CI (after deployment)
npm run test:perf
```

### Accessibility Testing
```bash
# Run accessibility tests (after deployment)
npm run test:a11y
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Deploy Fails at "Verify Vercel secrets"
**Symptom:** Missing VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, or VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add missing secrets from Vercel dashboard
3. Re-run the workflow

### Issue 2: Deploy Fails at "Verify core app env vars"
**Symptom:** Missing DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, or XAI_API_KEY

**Solution:**
1. Go to Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add missing variables for Production, Preview, and Development
3. Redeploy (automatic or manual)

### Issue 3: Health Ready Returns 503
**Symptom:** Database connection failed

**Solution:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
2. Check database is accessible from Vercel (IP allowlist)
3. Verify database exists and has tables
4. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

### Issue 4: XAI Returns Not Configured
**Symptom:** Missing XAI_API_KEY

**Solution:**
1. Add XAI_API_KEY to Vercel environment variables
2. Redeploy

### Issue 5: Build Fails with TypeScript Errors
**Symptom:** Type errors during build

**Solution:**
1. Run `npm run typecheck` locally
2. Fix errors
3. Commit and push
