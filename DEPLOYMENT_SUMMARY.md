## üîÑ Active Deployments

### Primary Deploy (Now)
**Workflow:** Deploy to Vercel  
**Trigger:** Push to main (commit `1424fd9`)  
**Status:** üîÑ Running  
**URL:** Check GitHub Actions job summary  
**Monitor:** https://github.com/Hostilian/collab-connect/actions

### Secondary Deploy (In ~10 minutes)
**Workflow:** Redeploy 10 minutes after deploy  
**Trigger:** Automatic after primary deploy succeeds  
**Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting for primary to complete  
**Purpose:** Force fresh deploy to ensure all changes propagate

---

## üéØ What Happens Next (Automatic)

### During Deploy (0-5 minutes)
1. ‚úÖ Pre-deploy checks run (lint, typecheck, test)
2. üîÑ Vercel CLI pulls environment variables
3. üîÑ Early validation: DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, XAI_API_KEY
4. üîÑ Build production artifacts (`vercel build --prod`)
5. üîÑ Deploy to Vercel production
6. üîÑ Job summary created with production URL
7. üîÑ Smoke tests run (home page + health endpoints)

### After Primary Deploy (5-15 minutes)
1. ‚è≥ Auto-redeploy workflow triggers
2. ‚è≥ Waits 10 minutes
3. ‚è≥ Creates empty commit: "ci: auto-redeploy 10 minutes after deploy"
4. ‚è≥ Pushes to main to trigger second deploy

### Post-Deploy Validation (15-20 minutes)
1. ‚è≥ E2E tests run against production (Playwright)
2. ‚è≥ Lighthouse performance audit
3. ‚è≥ Results uploaded as artifacts

## üìã Manual Verification Checklist

Once the deployment completes, verify:

### Critical Health Checks
```bash
# Get production URL from GitHub Actions job summary, then:
PROD_URL="https://collab-connect-XXXXX.vercel.app"

# Home page
curl -f $PROD_URL

# Health endpoints
curl -f $PROD_URL/api/health/live
curl -f $PROD_URL/api/health/ready

# XAI configuration status
curl -f $PROD_URL/api/ai/grok
```

### Key Features to Test
- [ ] Landing page loads with modern dark UI
- [ ] Auth pages accessible (/auth/signin, /auth/signup)
- [ ] Dashboard requires authentication
- [ ] Google OAuth flow works
- [ ] XAI/Grok API returns configured: true
- [ ] Email verification endpoint operational
- [ ] Map component renders (requires MapTiler key)

### Performance & Security
- [ ] Security headers present (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- [ ] Images optimized (WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Sentry receiving events

## üö® If Deploy Fails

### Missing Vercel Secrets
**Symptom:** "Missing one or more required secrets: VERCEL_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID"

**Fix:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hostilian/collab-connect/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add missing secrets
3. Re-run workflow manually or push another commit

### Missing App Environment Variables
**Symptom:** "Missing DATABASE_URL in .env.production.local" (or similar)

**Fix:**
1. Go to Vercel project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add the missing variables for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Re-run workflow

### Build Errors
**Symptom:** TypeScript or build failures

**Fix:**
1. Run locally: `npm run build`
2. Fix errors
3. Commit and push

### Database Connection Failed
**Symptom:** /api/health/ready returns 503 { status: "not_ready" }

**Fix:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct and accessible from Vercel
2. Check database provider firewall/IP allowlist
3. Ensure database is running and has tables (run `npx prisma migrate deploy`)
