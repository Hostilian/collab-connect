## Documentation Philosophy

These docs follow a simple rule:

> **If you're lost, there's a document for that.**

- Lost on setup? ‚Üí QUICKSTART.md
- Lost on vision? ‚Üí README.md
- Lost on commands? ‚Üí COMMANDS.md
- Lost on progress? ‚Üí ROADMAP.md
- Lost in general? ‚Üí CURRENT_STATUS.md

You should never have to guess what to do next.

---

## Keeping Docs Updated

As you build:

1. **Complete a task?** ‚Üí Update todo list
2. **Hit a milestone?** ‚Üí Update PROGRESS.md
3. **Add a feature?** ‚Üí Update REFERENCE.md
4. **Learn something?** ‚Üí Add to SETUP.md

Good docs = Future you saying "thank you"

---

## Pro Tips

1. Keep **CURRENT_STATUS.md** open - it's your north star
2. Bookmark **COMMANDS.md** - you'll use it daily
3. Check **ROADMAP.md** when you need motivation
4. Update the **todo list** as you work
5. Read **QUICKSTART.md** when you're confused

---

## What To Read Right Now

Seriously, if you haven't already:

1. Open **CURRENT_STATUS.md** ‚Üê Read this first
2. Follow the steps to set up your database
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Create an account
5. Come back when it's working

Everything else can wait. Get the database running first.
